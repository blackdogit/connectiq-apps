Connect IQ Description
-
This data field meant for long runs and races and will show you how long there are to the next planned
fuel point. This will hopefully help you takes the proper gels when needed - something I often forget
in the heat of a run or race where the mind is just on the distance ahead..

The field is based on simple configuration in the form of an array with
the distances between the fuel points in the users distance units (km/mi).
(Until Connect IQ supports configuration,
the configuration is just "[5]").

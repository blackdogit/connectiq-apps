Connect IQ Description
-
This data field meant for long runs and races and will show you how long there are to the next planned
fuel point. This will hopefully help you takes the proper fuel when needed - something I often forget
in the heat of a run where the mind is just on the distance ahead..

For now, the configuration is hard-coded and you will get a reminder for every 6 km. When Connect IQ supports
configuration of applications, a new version will be released, where you can configure your fuels points yourself. 

[Then the field is based on simple configuration in the form of an array with
the distances between the fuel points in the users distance units (km/mi).]

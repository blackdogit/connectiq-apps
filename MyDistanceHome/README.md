My Distance Back
================

Idea
----

Basically just to get something into the Connect IQ Store!

Adds a new data field that basically is identical to "Saved Positions"->"Information".
This does not require any additional information apart from what is currently (by 1.0.0) is
available in Toybox.Activity.Info.

Connect IQ Description
-
If you are running in the woods or if you are walking the dog, it is very nice to know how far you have back to the starting point - and very likely your house or your car.
This small data field will continuously show the distance and direction to the starting point - e.g. the location where you started the current activity.


Notes
-----

- For now, I just use Pythagorean Theorem as the distances are going to be less than 100 km, so it
does really matter...

Future Extensions
-----------------

Not only show text, but also an arrow for the right direction. Requires that the heading/bearing is available.
